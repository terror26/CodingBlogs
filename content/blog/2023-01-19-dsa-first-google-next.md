H﻿ello folks, \
\
A﻿s prestigious and amazing google sounds, its interview sounds that scarely and difficult. Why not to fix that , even better giving it a try to make you fall in love with coding . \
\
S﻿o here's my topic wise questions and what i learned new from each topic. After doing these, I believe whenever you are asked a question you will have some good insight plus intuitive thinking

S﻿o First :- 

1﻿. Arrays : 

\*implement-quicksort :  https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array  (Partition). : This can be the solution for Kth smallest element  

\*﻿ Largest Contiguous Sum : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/largest-contiguous , Sliding window will fix this.

\*﻿ Matrix Rotation : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/matrix-rotation : Please try to do this in O(1) space only .inplace . (Reason for inplace is interviewer will ask for this only).

\*﻿ Inversion Count: (  https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/inversion-count ) Mostly not asked but its better to know this. merge sort based.



2﻿. Two Pointers Approach : 

\*﻿ unique-elements-sorted-array : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/unique-elements-sorted-array . Again two pointers helps inplace.

\*﻿ Trapped-Rain-water :  https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/trapped-rain-water : Classical question for FAANGS

3﻿. Stacks & Queues: 

\* I﻿mplement Queue using stack : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/implement-queue-using-stacks 

\*﻿ Implement Stack using Queue : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/implement-stack-using-queues 

B﻿onus : Implement hashMap , follow up questions : what is the load factor , java 8 improvement in hashmap and implement it in 30 min. Suggested : See java 8 class implementation and how they did. I did it  ( https://github.com/terror26/HashMapImplementation) .

\*﻿ Implement Min Stack : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/min-stack : Required : O(1) pop, push , peek.

\*﻿ Largest Rectangle in histogram : https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/largest-rectangle-histogram : Hard question so better to give your best shot and then retry . O(n^2) should be done. O(n) required.
